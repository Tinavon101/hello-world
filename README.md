# hello-world

Hello everyone!
I am a undergraduate student who is double major in Finance and Statistics. But I am actually more interested in psychology and philosophy. These two subjects are my favorites! Do you guys have a little bit of knowledge in MBTI personality test or Carl Jung, a Swiss Psychiatrist? 
That is incredibly fun! 
Sometimes when I have a conversation with a person for more than one hour, I can probably have a guess about what personality type he/she is among 16 different types. I felt pretty obsessed with this and I myself is INTJ, as a female, and I am one of 1.8% in this world. Maybe? That is a joke. I think every personality has its own strengths and weaknesses. So all of them could be interesting when you start to understand and study them. 
However, in this big data era, I am kind of lost here because there are overwhelming choices out there. What kind of lifestyle you can achieve? These are all based on your inner thoughts and most importantly, your choices and tradeoffs. What do you want to hold tightly and what do you want to sacrifice because of that?
Okay, let me write this much, and you will find another meaning of life once it opens a new world for you!
